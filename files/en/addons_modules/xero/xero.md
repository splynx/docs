Xero accounting
=============================================

Splynx is able to sync customers, invoices/credit notes and payments with Xero accounting software - https://www.xero.com


<icon class="image-icon">![Important](warning.png)</icon> **IMPORTANT:**

**It's recommended do not configure the add-on on your own.**
**Please, contact our support team before starting the accounting integration.**

To install the Xero add-on, navigate to `Config → Integrations → Add-ons`:

![addons](addons.png)

In the list of available add-ons, click on the `Update (apt)` button, then locate or search for `splynx-xero`. Once located, click on the *Install* button in the *Actions* column to begin the installation process:

![install](install.png)

To install the add-on via CLI, use the following commands:

```bash
apt-get update  
apt-get install splynx-xero
```

Once the installation has completed, navigate to `Config → Integrations → Modules list` and click on the edit button in the *Actions* column:

![modules](modules_list.png)

![edit xero module](edit_xero_module.png)

The general configuration of the Xero integration module can be viewed and edited here. First of all we need to enable **Entry points status for portal** and specify the **Splynx domain** in the `Accounting API settings` section.

The **Splynx domain** must be the same as the **API domain URL** but without the last slash `/`. **HTTPS is required!**

![settings1](settings1.png)

### Synchronization settings:

![settings1](settings2.png)

- **Payment method ID** - select the payment method for imported payments. Payments with selected method id will not be pushed to Xero;

- **Payment statement grouping** - group payment statements by "month" or "day";

- **Partners ignore list** - select the [partners](administration/main/partners/partners.md) of which will be ignored in the sync process. Customers, invoices and payments of the partners selected here, **WILL NOT** be synced with Xero;

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon>  **NOTE:** Only one partner should be synced - the multiple partner sync is not supported in accounting integrations.

- **Payments synchronization direction** - define the direction of syncing payments: `Xero → Splynx`, `Splynx → Xero` or `Bidirectional`. If **Xero to Splynx** direction is selected - all payments which were created in Splynx will not be synced to Xero;

- **Payments reference field** - select the payment field whose value will be sent as a payment reference when synchronizing payments to Xero;

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

![payments_reference_field](prf1.png)

![payments_reference_field](prf2.png)

</div>
</details>
<br>

- **Payments push to Xero** - select the [payment methods](configuration/finance/payment_methods/payment_methods.md) to sync to Xero. This selection only applies if the selected method to sync payments is set to `Splynx → Xero`;

![settings1](settings2_1.png)

- **Import payments from date** - specify the date in 'Y-m-d'(2021-03-31) format, which will be used as the start date for importing all payments;

- **Import prepayments from date** - specify the date in 'Y-m-d'(2021-03-31) format, which will be used as the start date for importing all prepayments;

- **Import overpayments from date** - specify the date in 'Y-m-d'(2021-03-31) format, which will be used as the start date for importing all overpayments (if customer accidentally pays too much);

- **Xero non invoices/credit notes payment type** - used to choose the type (`Prepayment` or `Overpayment`) of Splynx payment to export without invoice;



<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">


A separate account has a rolling balance as a contra account for all payments that come from Splynx. Some customers paid R500 instead of R499 and the prepayments were allocated to your separate account.
On allocation, you’ll take R499 of the payment to the invoice, and the R1 will just remain in the account as a running total. At the end of the year, the R1 amount will be significant and unallocated on the account.
It would be much easier if all R500 could simply be allocated to the client's account. Then, we can allocate R499 from the overpayment to the invoice and the R1 'overpayment' will end up in the customer's balance.

- **Create exceeding invoices/credit notes payments in Xero** - toggle in the enabled state allows to create a payment in Xero when the Splynx payment amount exceeds the Xero `Due` document amount. On Xero side will be created a payment with the type chosen in the **Xero non invoice payment type** select menu (`Prepayment` or `Overpayment`). Such payment won't be linked to the invoice.
In disabled status, when there is a partially paid invoice on Xero side, a Splynx payment won't be exported to Xero and you will see the error message - `A validation exception occurred - Payment amount exceeds the amount outstanding on this document` in `Administration → Logs → Accounting integrations`.


<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

Let's say in Xero add-on config, we use the `Overpayment` value in the **Xero non invoice/credit notes payment type** select menu. The **Create exceeding invoices/credit notes payments in Xero** toggle is **disabled**. The option **Create payments for prepayments** is **disabled**.

The exported invoice on Xero side is partially paid e.g. from customer balance, as a result the invoice due is 75:

![image](exc3.png)

![image](exc4.png)

Then, the customer pays the total amount of the invoice in Splynx and this new payment is synced to Xero.

As a result we have the following error when exporting a payment, you can see it directly in the `Finance → Xero Accounting` section:

```
2022-02-07 15:50:30.847000 Start payments synchronization from Splynx to Xero

Also, you can check the log in `Administration → Logs → Accounting integrations`

![image](exc5.png)

To fix this problem, it's necessary to enable **Create exceeding invoices/credit notes payments in Xero** toggle and press **Save**, after that, export a new payment from Splynx to Xero one more time.

<icon class="image-icon">![Important](warning.png)</icon> **IMPORTANT:** This exported payment will not be linked to the customer's invoice, but it will be added as `overpayment` (or `prepayment`, it depends on the selected option) to the bank account balance on Xero side:

![image](exc8.png)

![image](exc9.png)

Finally, you can make corrections for payments and if it's necessary, remove overpayment on Xero side

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](warning.png)</icon> **NOTE:**

If the option **Create payments for prepayments** is not used (a toggle is **disabled**) and you decide to import the (overpayments) payments from Xero to Splynx, such payments will be imported to Splynx as payment statements and should be paired with the necessary customer (-s) manually.

- **Prepayments Account code** - a unique code (limited to 10 characters) of prepayments items (the expenditures that have been paid for in advance) in Xero account (`Accounting menu → Advanced → Chart of Accounts`);

- **Rounding Account code** - a unique code (limited to 10 characters) of rounding item (an adjustment entry to allow for rounding) in Xero account (`Accounting menu → Advanced → Chart of Accounts`);

- **Create payments for prepayments** - a toggle allows to enable creating payment for prepayment (a payment made in advance) in Splynx or, in disabled status - add such payment to the payment (bank) statements only. Used on payments import;

- **Create payments for overpayments** - a toggle allows to enable creating payment for overpayment in Splynx or, in disabled status - add such payment to the payment (bank) statements only. Used on payments import;

- **Create payments without invoices/credit notes** - a toggle allows to enable/disable creating payment in Splynx when customer doesn't have invoice. Used on payments import. **Attention:** in some cases can lead to duplicate payments;

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

<!-- Check the task SAXERO-139 -->

Let say, we have the following case: Customer has an unpaid invoice for R100. This invoice was exported to Xero and partially paid there in the amount of R20. At the same time, the unpaid invoice in Splynx was paid for the full amount and the payments were exported to Xero. Finally, all payments were imported from Xero to Splynx.

The next settings are used:

![image](cpwi.png)

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> **NOTE:** Splynx v3.1 doesn't support functionality with auto payment, or rather, payments do not pay invoices automatically.

As a result,

- in Splynx v3.1: the R100 payment that was made in Splynx will be exported to Xero as overpayment and the imported R20 payment will be shown in `Finance → History` as bank statement, such statement can be manually paired to the necessary customer.

- in Splynx v4.1: the R100 payment that was made in Splynx will be exported to Xero as overpayment and the R20 payment will be imported to Splynx and linked to the necessary customer as a new payment.

</div>

- **Ignore expense payments on import** - a toggle allows to enable/disable ignoring 'Spend money' (a payment that doesn't relate to a bill, expense claim, or refund) in Xero payments during payments import. If option is enabled, 'Spend money' payments will not be added to bank statements;

![settings1](settings2_3.png)

- **Customer name pattern** - used to set the format of the customer name during the sync to Xero. The value will be visible in **Contact Name** field of customer contact information on Xero side. The following variables can be used in the field: `{id}`, `{login}`, `{name}`, `{email}`;

- **Customer account number pattern** - set the format of customer **Account number** field during the sync to Xero. The max field length is 50 symbols. The following variables can be used: `{id}`,`{login}`;

- **Invoice/Credit note reference pattern** - set the format of invoice / credit note (`credit note` - *the Xero term, it's an invoice with negative total price in Splynx v3.1*) **Reference** field during the sync to Xero. The max field length is 255 symbols. The following variables can be used: `{id}`, `{number}`, `{date}` (e.g. Dec 2021);

- **Decimal Places** - by default, Xero is rounding prices to `2` decimal places. `4` decimal places can be used instead.


### Cron settings

![settings1](settings3.png)

These are the global settings to automatically sync items between the two platforms, in any selected direction of syncing.

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> **NOTE:** It is recommended that all settings in the **Cron settings** section should be disabled for the initial set up of the add-on to avoid syncing all these elements automatically via cron jobs, the first import and export should be done manually in `Finance → Xero Accounting`

- **Customers** - enables/disables automatic syncing of customers;
- **Invoices** - enables/disables automatic syncing of invoices;
- **Credit notes** - enables/disables automatic syncing of credit notes;
- **Payments** - enables/disables automatic syncing of payments.


### Let's start with Xero

Click on `Finance` item on the sidebar of Splynx and in the drop-down menu click on `Xero Accounting`.

![xero icon](xero_icon.png)

In the next step, we have to connect the Xero account with Splynx. To achieve this, click on the `Connect to Xero` button:

![connect with Xero](connect.png)

Or click on the small gear <icon class="image-icon">![gear_icon](gear_icon.png)</icon> icon on the right side of the window and choose the same option:

![connect with Xero](connect1.png)

![connect with Xero](connect2.png)

After linking your Xero account with Splynx you will see a list of Xero organizations. Select the organization which you will use with Splynx:

![organizations](select_organization.png)

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> **NOTE:** **All customers, invoices/credit notes and payments will only be synced with the selected organization. If the organization must be changed in the Splynx Xero add-on, you will have to reset all synced invoices/credit notes, customers, and payments, and start from scratch.**
**The information how to reset the accounting database you can find below of this tutorial.**

When the Xero account linking process is completed, the next step is to import mapping settings (chart accounts, tax rates, and bank accounts from Xero) into Splynx. Click on the `Import mapping settings into Splynx` button to achieve this.

![mapping](mapping_settings.png)

When this process is completed, navigate to `Config → Finance` and find the following sections: **Accounting categories**, **Accounting bank accounts** and **Accounting taxes** - each of which will have to be configured.

![config-finance](config_finance.png)

Let's start with **Accounting categories**:

![accounting_categories](accounting_categories.png)
![accounting_categories](accounting_categories2.png)

In `Categories map` section, ALL categories must be selected with the related item from `Accounting categories` table. Pay attention to the `Additional 2` field in `Accounting categories` table, each category should have an account code. To enable displaying of additional fields, click on the breadcrumbs (column selector) button at the top right of the table and simply enable the necessary fields to display:

![show fields](show_fields.png)

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> **NOTE:** **If the synced category has no account code - Xero will not be able to sync invoices/credit notes for this category.**

As soon as the relevant categories are configured, we can proceed with **bank accounts**:

![bank accounts](bank_accounts.png)
![bank accounts](bank_accounts2.png)

We will follow the same procedure with bank accounts, each bank account should have an account code (`Additional 3` field here) and the default bank account should be selected.

The last step in the accounting config is **tax rates** configuration. The tax values in Splynx must match the same values in Xero:

![taxes](taxes.png)
![taxes](taxes2.png)

Once `Accounting categories`, `Accounting bank accounts` and `Accounting tax rates` are configured, the Splynx Xero add-on is ready to start syncing.

In our test environment, we have 2 customers and a few invoices for each customer, let's export them to Xero:

![customers sync](customers_sync.png)


Once the customer export has completed, we can start export their invoices to Xero:

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> **NOTE:**

- **The invoices without transactions or marked as Deleted in Splynx will not be synced to Xero;**

- **If the invoice includes item with a given period of time in Splynx, such period will be added to the related item description on Xero side after sync.**


<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">


![image](invoice_with_period1.png)

![image](invoice_with_period2.png)


</div>
</details>


![invoices_sync](invoices_sync.png)

On the Xero side, we can see our synced customers and invoices:

![xero customer](xero_customer.png)

![xero customer](xero_inv.png)

For example, customers have paid 2 invoices in Splynx. Now we can export payments from `Splynx → Xero`:

![image](exp_payments.png)

![image](paid_inv.png)

Let's add 2 payments to the unpaid invoice on Xero side:

![image](add_payment1.png)

![image](add_payment2.png)

![image](add_payment1_1.png)

![image](add_payment2_1.png)

Now we can sync payments from `Xero → Splynx` by clicking on `Import new payments into Splynx`. Only payment which is matched to a corresponding customer will be created in Splynx.

![sync payments](import_payments.png)

Payments which we've synced from Xero can be viewed in `Finance → Payment statements → History`:

![bank statements](bank_statements.png)

Here you can check the status of synchronization in relation to each payment item. More information can be found in
[Payment statement processing](finance/payment_statement_processing/payment_statement_processing.md) tutorial.

![statements list](statements_list.png)


Sometimes it's required to manually pair a statement record (create a payment in Splynx) to a customer, for example a prepayment (overpayment) was received on the Xero side.

![image](prepayment.png)

To do the manual pair, open `Finance → Payment statements → History`, choose Xero statements then click on the <icon class="image-icon">![manual_pair_icon](manual_pair_icon.png)</icon> icon related to the item that is need to be paired:

![image](prepayment1.png)

Then find the necessary customer, invoice or proforma invoice to pair with:

![manual_pair2](manual_pair1.png)

![manual_pair2](manual_pair2.png)

We recommend to check payment (bank) statements on a regular basis.

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> **NOTE:** If on Xero side was applied **Remove & Redo** action to delete an account transaction for the payment related to the invoice (the status will be *Deleted*) or for the prepayment / overpayment (the status will be *Voided*), such items won't be imported to Splynx:

![image](ignore_payments.png)


### Xero logs

Sync logs can be found under `Administration → Logs → Accounting integrations`:

![logs](logs.png)

If a customer/invoice/credit note/payment has an `Accounting ID`, this indicates that it was synced, if not - it was not synced.

![logs customers](logs_customer.png)

The same for invoices/credit notes and payments: if `Accounting ID` is present - it was synced:

`Invoice ID` corresponds with Splynx invoice ID's.

![logs invoices](logs_invoices.png)

`Payment ID` corresponds with payment ID's in Splynx.

### Xero tweaks

![xero tweaks](xero_tweaks.png)

In this menu, there are a few more settings and tools related to the Xero add-on:

* **Connect to Xero** - if the Splynx-Xero addon was disconnected from the Xero account, you have to reconnect here;

* **Refresh OAuth Token** - setting to refresh the OAuth token;

* **Edit connection** - used for editing the connection with Xero, when the credentials were changed in Xero;

* **Manual Synchronization** - used to open `Finance → Xero Accounting` when you are located in other menu window;

* **Customers manual pairing** - this function is used where there are existing customers in Splynx as well as Xero. There is a `Load Xero customers for manual pairing` button. This feature pulls the customer list from Xero into Splynx and allows the admin to manually pair the customers without having to create them in either platform again;

![load for pair](load_for_manual_pairing.png)

![pair customer](pair_customer.png)

We have 3 customers and they are paired, if the status is `Not paired` in the "status" field, you can find the required customer from Xero to pair with this customer.

* **Tools** - this menu is used for resetting the accounting database, all items that were selected previously in `Accounting categories`, `Accounting bank accounts` and `Accounting tax rates` will be erased. It is mainly used when the organization changes. Before changing the organization, the accounting database must be reset:

![xero tools](xero_tools.png)

* **Module Config** - the link is used to open the Xero add-on configuration page (`Config → Integrations → Modules list → Xero Accounting`).
