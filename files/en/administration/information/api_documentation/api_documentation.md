API Documentation
=============
Splynx system has its own Application Programming Interface (API) which allows software applications to communicate with each other via API calls. In order to simplify the workflow with Splynx API in testing and development you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
Postman - is an Open Source tool and can be easily downloaded [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) according to your desired platform. After install the app and sign up for account you can start work on Postman startup screen.

For example, let's generate the token for authorization and GET request. Please note that it's necessary to create an admin user account in Splynx and assign the role e.g. super administrator, it depends on what the access rights you need.

As you can see, there is an output result about user in the body section, it indicates that test has run successfully. The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. Postman has [great documentation](https://learning.getpostman.com/) to help you to get started.
