Pending statuses & services
======================

![icon.png](icon.png)

The pending statuses & services logs tables show the list of statuses or plans with forthcoming changes, e.g. when customer's status is set to be changed on a particular day or a new service will be activated on a specific day.

**Pending statuses** - this section displays the *date* of change, *customer's id* and *status* (new, activate, inactive, blocked). To view a customer's information you can simply click on the *customer's id* in the table.

**Pending services** - this section displays the *date* of change, *customer's id*, *description* of the service, its *price*, *type* and *plan*. To view the *service plan* information you can simply click on the name of the plan in the column of the table.


### How to set up pending change of status

To set up a pending change of status for a customer, click on the *Calendar* icon next to the *Status* <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon1](view_icon1.png)</icon> in the *customer's Information* tab. You can then set the date when the status will be changed and choose the desired status to change to and save the result.

 Then, choose the plan and fill up the rest of fields in open window if needed: *Start date, Type of Connection, Router* etc. You can also turn on a *Discount* option here, so customer will be charged with discounted price for the service. Set up the start date for the service.

In case the customer already has the active service and you would like to change it, open the `Customer's Services` tab and click on <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon4](view_icon5.png)</icon> in order to change the plan. In the new window you can choose a *New service* and specify its *Start date*. A new service plan will be added in pending status

After the service has been added, it's possible to check its status in `Administration → Logs → Pending statuses & services` (<icon class="image-icon">![image](warning.png)</icon> only if the start date differs from today's date and it has pending status).

<icon class="image-icon">![image](warning.png)</icon> Please note that there is a difference between the *Service end date* and the date when the service status (or customer's status) will be changed:

***Service end date:***

For example, we set the service end date to 01.03.2023, it means that the service will still be active throughout the indicated day (01.03.2023) and only on 02.03.2023 at 00:00 the service becomes disabled.

***Date of service/customer's status change:***

For example, we schedule the service status change for 01.03.2023. It means that on that day (01.03.2023) at 00:00, the service status will be changed.
