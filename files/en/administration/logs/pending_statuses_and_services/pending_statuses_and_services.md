The pending statuses & services logs tables show the list of statuses or plans with forthcoming changes, e.g. when customer's status is set to be changed on a particular day or a new service will be activated on a specific day.

**Pending statuses** - this section displays the *date* of change, *customer's id* and *status* (new, activate, inactive, blocked). To view a customer's information you can simply click on the *customer's id* in the table.

**Pending services** - this section displays the *date* of change, *customer's id*, *description* of the service, its *price*, *type* and *plan*. To view the *service plan* information you can simply click on the name of the plan in the column of the table.


**How to set up pending change of status**

To set up a pending change of status for a customer click on the *Calendar* icon next to the *Status* <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon1](view_icon1.png)</icon> in the *customer's Information* tab.

 Then, choose the plan and fill up the rest of fields in open window if needed: *Start date, Type of Connection, Router* etc. You can also turn on a *Discount* option here, so customer will be charged with discounted price for the service. Set up the start date for the service. If it is any forthcoming date, the *pending* status for the service will be set automatically. On a planned start date of the service its status will be automatically changed to active as well.

After service has been added it's possible to check its status in `Administration → Logs → Pending statuses & services` (only if start date differs from today's date and it has pending status)*.
