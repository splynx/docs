**Pending statuses** - this section displays the *date* of change, *customer's id* and *status* (new, activate, inactive, blocked). To view a customer's information you can simply click on the *customer's id* in the table.

**Pending services** - this section displays the *date* of change, *customer's id*, *description* of the service, its *price*, *type* and *plan*. To view the *service plan* information you can simply click on the name of the plan in the column of the table.

 Then, choose the plan and fill up the rest of fields in open window if needed: *Start date, Type of Connection, Router* etc. You can also turn on a *Discount* option here, so customer will be charged with discounted price for the service. Set up the start date for the service. If it is any forthcoming date, the *pending* status for the service will be set automatically. On a planned start date of the service its status will be automatically changed to active as well.
