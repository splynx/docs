#### Helpdesk

By clicking on the helpdesk icon <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon5](helpdeski.png)</icon> in the *Actions* column of the table, we can change the scope of the administrators access to tickets. The feature allows you to restrict administrators to only view/interact with tickets you wish to grant them access to. This feature only restricts the administrator's access to tickets by your selection of scope, it does not change any permissions you have granted to the administrator, it only narrows or broadens the scope of ticket the admin will have access to with the same permissions you have granted the admin via the role assigned or the custom permissions you have selected for the admin.

There are 3 scopes you can assign an administrator to:

* **Global** - selecting this option will give the administrator access to all tickets on the system.
* **Group** - selecting this option will limit the administrator to a specific group which you will have to specify upon clicking this option.

* **Restricted** - restricts the administrators access to the tickets which are assigned to them.

To remove an administrator account from the system, click on the trash <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon5](view_icon5.png)</icon> icon in the Actions' column.

It is possible **to view all the operations executed by each Administrator** by navigating to *Administration → Logs → Operations*. If you click on the details <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon6](view_icon6.png)</icon> icon in Actions column of the table you will be able to see details of each operation:

There is a way to limit the access to information for admins in Splynx by selecting only one partner, so the administrator will only be able to operate with all information associated with one particular partner. Click on the  *Edit icon* <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon7](view_icon7.png)</icon> in the Actions column and window will appear, where it will be possible to choose one partner or the option *Any* to give the admin access to all the partners and their information on the system.

![Limit access per partner](del2.png)

You can also change permissions for adding, editing or deleting partner (s) for the particular administrator by clicking on the permissions <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon8](view_icon8.png)</icon> icon in Actions column. In the window that will appear, click on the *Administration section*, and enable or disable the *Partner* section and choose additional permissions of the Partner you'd like to assign to the administrator.
