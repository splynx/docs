In this section we can configure, add and edit API keys used by the system.

This section displays a table of all API keys used by add-ons, information (such as the name of the addon, api key and the partner it is associated with):

In the *Actions column* you can *Edit*, change *permissions* for the API key/add-on or *delete* the API key:

**Actions**:

With use of the *Edit* icon <icon class="image-icon">![Edit](edit_icon.png)</icon> you can edit the configurations of the API key in the fields that are available. If the field is greyed out, this means it cannot be edited:

With the use of the Permissions icon <icon class="image-icon">![permissions](perm_icon.png)</icon> you can modify the permissions of the API key to limit or grant access to each of the modules:
