**Costs of support**

This tab shows the value of support via tickets in correspondence with company revenue per customer. The formula to compute the **MRR Cost (per action)** is the next:
```
(Total actions / Monthly Recurring Revenue) * Quantity of customer services
```

**Total actions (in `+` out `+` notes)** is divided on **Monthly Recurring Revenue**, after that the result is multiplied by **Quantity of customer services**.
