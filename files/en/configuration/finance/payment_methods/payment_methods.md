Some payment methods are set by default. When you install a new payment module (e.g. SageOne, Netcash, Stripe, etc.), it will automatically appear in the list.  

You can add a new Payment method manually by clicking the `Add` button at the top right corner of the page.  The window will appear where you need to type the name of the payment method and enable the option *"Active"*.
