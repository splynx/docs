Simply enable or disable each module as desired or required.

***Example:*** We have enabled *the Leads* module:

![crm_enabled](crm_enabled.png)

It is visible on the navigation pane. For example, we will not use the Leads module on our system, therefore we can disable it:

![crm_disabled](crm_disabled.png)

As you can see the Leads module disappeared from our navigation pane.
