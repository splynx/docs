Stock locations are used to identify where inventory items are stored.

Navigate to [Inventory → Items](inventory/items/items.md):

Stock locations can be selected for each item in the inventory. Also, a whole list of items can be sorted by stock location, simply select the desired location in the "Stock location" drop-down list.
