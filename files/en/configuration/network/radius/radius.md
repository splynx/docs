#### These are Rejected IP addresses of which you can modify the ranges:

![Reject IP range](reject_adresses.png)

* **Reject IP 0** - Reject IP range when a user is not found (real);
* **Reject IP 1** - Reject IP range when a user is blocked, not active or not in system;
* **Reject IP 2** - Reject IP range when a user has a negative balance or a filter is applied;
* **Reject IP 3** - Reject IP range when a user has the wrong MAC address (if enabled) or other error;
* **Reject IP 4** - Reject IP range when a user has entered the wrong password.

Select the NAS type you are going to use and click on the **Load** button. You can use a default type or create a new NAS type. More information about NAS type creation is available [here](configuration/network/nas_types/nas_types.md).
