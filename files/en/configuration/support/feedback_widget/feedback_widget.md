## POP-UP WIDGET

Pop-up widgets can be placed on websites as a small rectangle box somewhere on the page for quick access.<br>
The size, color, alignment and form settings can be changed here. The "Use HTTPS" button refers to where your query will be redirected to, so if you have installed HTTPS/SSL on your server, please keep this option enabled.<br>
Make sure that all changes are applied before using this result code. If something has been changed, the code will be re-generated and you can simply copy and paste it onto your website code.

## EMBEDDED WIDGET
