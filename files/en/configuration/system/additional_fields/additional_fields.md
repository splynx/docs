## Adding a new additional/custom field:

A window will appear where you can create the additional field. In this example, a "Contract ID" field is created as an additional field for the Customers module.

* **Customer category** - specify which type of customers this field will be available to, options are *All, Customer only or Private Company only*. (***This field only applies to additional fields for the customer module***)
* **Field name** - specify a name for the field for the system to recognize it in the database.
* **Field title** - specify the common name of the field on the system interface.
* **Type** - specify the type/format of data to be used as values for this field.
* **Default value** - specify a default value to be used as a prefix for the data entered in this field.
* **Required** - enabling this option makes this field mandatory to complete.
* **Unique** -  enabling this option requires a unique value to be filled in for this field for all customers.
* **Show in the list** - enables the field to be displayed automatically in the list/table of the selected module as a column.
* **Add** - this option enables/disables the field as a field to fill in within the selected module when adding a new item to the module.(in this example, this option enables/disables the "Contract ID" field, when adding a new customer)
* **Searchable** - enabling/disabling this option states whether items in the selected module can be search for by the values of this field(in this example, this option enables or disables the ability to search for customers by their "Contract id").
* **Set default value for** - this option enables/disables the use of the default value specified in the **Default value** field as the prefix for the value. This option is convenient for fields that consists of values that begin with the same data/number/letters etc. (in this example, this field would add the value specified in the **Default value** as the beginning of the "Contract ID" or the ID itself if it is not modified).


The new created field will be displayed in the Additional Fields table and in the Customer Information view:
