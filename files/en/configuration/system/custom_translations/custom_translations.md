Custom translations
===================

Custom translations enable you to make your own translation of the Splynx system, available for you and your customers in the Customer Portal. Custom translation can be done in any language. To add custom translations navigate to `Config → System → Custom translations`.

There are two ways of translating: by key words and by categories.

### Translation by key words

To add a translation choose a language first, then click on the *Add* button at the top-right corner of the page. The window will appear where you can type a key word to search for in the "Message" field. This word will appear in all categories it's been used.

1. Choose a language to translate.

You can also use the Search option to find a particular word in that category. For example, if we will look for a word "Invoice" in Administration category after loading the translation of the category, the system will give us results matching the search criteria:
