**Parameter descriptions**

* **Title** - type in a relevant name for the template
* **Description** - type a brief description of the template
* **Code** - populate this field with all the contents you would like the template to contain. Variables, links and placeholders can be used in templates.

When creating templates, you can conveniently make use of "Placeholders", which are code values to populate details existing on the system of a customer or company:

![Placeholders](template4.png)

For example, we will use the customers "full name" placeholder:

![Placeholders](template5.png)

![Placeholders](template6.png)

We can check the validity of the code by clicking on the *Check Code* button or simply check the result of the code by clicking on preview:

![Placeholders](check_preview.png)

![Placeholders](template8.png)

When using the preview option to check the result of the code the system will always use the last customer you've interacted with: "Use last found entity for preview".

Additionally, you can view variables that can be used in templates in [Template Variables](configuration/system/templates/templates_variables/templates_variables.md).
