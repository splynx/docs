------------

**Adminer** - is a full-featured database management tool used to access your Splynx server database. We use the [fork](https://github.com/splynx/adminer) of the official tool which is adopted to the Splynx requirements.

All data on your server can be accessed and operated with *Adminer*. This is our method of accessing your database to resolve any changes/errors that may occur or may be inexplicable from the information displayed in the GUI of your Splynx server.

**Step 1**

**Adminer** is integrated into Splynx as an add-on. To install it, open `Config → Integrations → Add-ons`, find `splynx-adminer` item and click on the *Install* icon:
