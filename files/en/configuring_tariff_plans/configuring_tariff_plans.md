Configuring Tariff Plans
========================

This is where all your tariff plans for **services** are created, edited and stored.

In Splynx there are three types of tariff plans, namely: *Internet*, *Voice*, and *Custom* plans. These are the main plans and are more commonly used, however, there are also options to create *One-Time* charges and *Bundles*.

Tariff plans are assigned to customers as services and these are the means by which we charge our customers.

**Internet plans** can be created to control internet speeds, limit bandwidth usage(CAP) and create rules for usage (FUP). <br>
**Voice plans** are created to charge customers for voice services and used for CDR processing. <br>
**Custom plans** are created to charge for unique services like IPTV services, public IP addresses, and other similar services. <br>
**One-Time plans** are items used to charge customers once off, these are your non-recurring charges like installation fees, etc.<br>
**Bundles** are created to group internet, voice and custom plans, to charge customers for packages instead of multiple separate services.
