One-Time plans
==============

These are non-recurring charges used regularly which include services like, call out fees, the initial connection of customers, materials used in conduit, etc.

To create a new One-Time plan, navigate to _Tariff plans → One-time_ and click on ``Add plan``.

To be able to set your VAT percentage amount, you need first add it in _Config → Finance → Taxes_. Then you can select it in _VAT_ field. For more information see [Taxes](configuration/finance/taxes/taxes.md).

Once the one-time plan is created, it is possible to edit or delete it with the icons in _Actions_ column of the one-time plans list:  <icon class="image-icon">![edit.png](edit.png)</icon> or <icon class="image-icon">![delete.png](delete.png)</icon>

Like all tables in Splynx, you can modify the appearance of content to be displayed and export the table into Excel, CSV or PDF formats. You can also choose to copy or print the table:

After the One-Time plan is created, you can do the following:

**1. Add one-time invoice**

In the customer's _Billing → Finance documents_ tab there is an option to add One-time invoices:

Just like with _One-time invoices_, the same logic can be used for proforma invoices. Navigate to the customer's _Billing → Finance documents_ tab and add a proforma invoice:
