Voice plans
===========


This is the home of your voice services you will provide to your customers.

**Why use Voice plans in Splynx?**

We can provide two main reasons using Splynx for voice plans:

1. Charging customers monthly fees for voice services such as VOIP, Toll numbers, Number rentals or Mobile plans.
2. Processing of VOIP CDR's. Splynx can automatically or manually process the CDR's from Voice platforms, attach calls from CDRs to corresponding customers, create transactions for voice service usage and make one common invoice for Voice and Internet services.

To configure a voice plan, navigate to _Tariff plans → Voice_ and click on the _Add plan_ button found in the top right of the page.
