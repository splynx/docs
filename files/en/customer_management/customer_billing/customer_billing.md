Customer billing
==========
This is your centralized finance department for each customer. Here you can customize your customer's billing to suit agreements and unique terms made with the respective customer, with regards to how they will be billed and interactions thereof.

The Customer Billing tab is divided into 5 sub-tabs:


* **Billing Overview** - The main information configuration page of your customer billing.
* **Transactions** - All transactions pertaining to the customer can be found here
* **Invoices** - All invoices generated for the customer can be found here
* **Payments** - All payments made by or on behalf of the customer.
* **Proforma Invoices** - A list of all proforma invoices is kept for future reference


## Billing Overview

Billing Overview displays 5 main sections:

* Billing Settings
* Proforma Invoice Settings
* Payment Accounts
* Billing Address
* Reminders Settings

## Billing Settings:.

* **Deactivation period** (the old term **Grace period**) - when the customer's services will be marked as inactive, client no longer uses services and the system no longer accounts for it
* **Minimal balance** - minimal balance required in the customer account to avoid being blocked

Please note that if you are charging a customer **manually**, the new invoice will only be created if the Invoicing option is enabled in `Customer's Billing → Billing Overview → Billing settings`.

![Billing settings](billing_settings_charge.png)

By default, when customer uses recurring billing, the settings `Create invoices (after Charge & Invoice)`, `Auto pay invoices from account balance`, and `Send finance notifications` are turned on. Ability to automatically use money from balance is useful for overpayment scenarios.

When charging customers, if necessary, discounts for customers services can be added. Discounts are applied in the customers services. Navigate to customers services tab and select the desired service to apply the discount to, click on Edit icon <icon class="image-icon">![Edit button](edit_button.png)</icon>. The edit service window will appear where you can apply the discount according to the parameters highlighted and you may add a note for reference in discount message. After a discount has been configured, it will appear in the <icon class="image-icon">![Charge button](charge_button.png)</icon> window and the final price will automatically be calculated.
