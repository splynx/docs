Customer documents
==========

As a company with many customers, you've probably found that keeping physical copies of all the contracts and agreements for each customer in files and folders, in boxes and closets is inefficient and impractical which often leads to confusion in business. You don't have to worry about it anymore, we've digitized this much-needed form of record keeping.

Our **Documents** section allows you to upload documents in any format, providing a secure, neat and easy to manage way to store customer documents. What's more, in *Documents* section it is possible to generate a document according to the templates created for it.

### How to upload a document to Splynx

**To upload a document to Splynx** click on ``Upload`` button at the top right corner of the table and a pop-up window **Upload file** will appear. In this window you can specify a **Title** of the document, a short **Description** (optional) and choose whether this document will be **Visible to customer** on their [Portal](customer_portal/customer_portal.md) or only available for the administrator. Then, click on ``Browse`` and choose the document to upload.

In the **Operations** column of the table you'll find possible actions related to the file, such as `Edit` , `View` , `Download` , `Send` (to a customer) and `Delete` <icon class="image-icon">![Icons](icons.png)</icon>.

If you upload the file with the `Visible to customer` option enabled, the file will be available to download for the customer on their Portal under the *Documents* section.

There are two options to generate the **Document code** (the message body) of the document:

* **Option 1** - simply type the desired content in the text window manually, use `Save as new` button to save the typed text as a new document template in Splynx, and then click on `Generate`:

* **Option 2** - you can use one of the saved [Templates](configuration/system/templates/templates.md) to create/generate a document. Click on the **Template** drop-down list, select a necessary template and press `Load` button.
This will fill the text area with pre-configured content from the template.
Then, you should specify a **Title** of the document, a short **Description** (optional) and choose whether this document will be **Visible to customer** on *Portal*.

**IMPORTANT**

Before using the own **templates** it is necessary to **configure** them first in `Config → System → Templates`. In Splynx, the templates are grouped according to the document type. You can add your own templates, edit/customize the existing ones, make a preview or remove the templates.

![Template icon](template_menu_icon.png)

When `Config → Templates` page is opened, take a look at the top right corner and select `Documents`type in drop-down list.

![Template's types](template_types.png)

**To create a new template** click on the ``Add`` button. In new window, specify the `Title`, `Description` (optional) and insert or type the HTML code for your template.

Use `Check Code` and `Preview` buttons to check or to preview the validity of the code / output result. The `Placeholders` button can be used to quickly insert the necessary variable into the code.

### Contract and its signing by customer

A customer contract is a legally binding agreement between you and the customer concerning the sale of goods or digital content or the supply of services (with or without goods).
You use the traditional post service or email (attachment) to send a contract to the customer and wait for it to return signed.
As a result, you are not sure whether the customer has received the contract, read it, or perhaps have already sent it back. Such situation is very common for people in sales and may feel annoying. But there is a solution.

You can create your own contract using the functionality of template and customer can add their 'electronic' signature withing Splynx. Such approach eliminates the costs and hassle of printing, scanning and delivery.


**Create a contract template:**

1. Navigate to `Config → System → Templates`, at the top right corner, select `Documents`type in drop-down list;

2. Click `Add` button in order to add a new template;

3. Fill out the fields `Title`, `Description` (optional) and `Code`. Pay attention that in the contract template code should be included the next variables:

**To show customer's signature image in contract (required):**

```
<img src="{{signature}}">
```

**To show the signature date (optional):**

```
{{sign_date}}
```

**To show the end of term (optional):**

```
{{end_of_term}}
```

**To show the document id (optional):**

```
{{id}}
```

**To show who added the document (optional):**

```
{{added_by}}
```
or

```
{{added_by_id}}
```


Use `Placeholders` button to quickly insert the necessary variable into the code and customize your template.

The **code example of the Contract** you can find [here](configuration/system/templates/templates_variables/templates_variables.md).

After the template code is ready press **Save** button.

4. In `Customers → List`, find the customer to whom the contract should be sent to, open customer's profile, navigate to `Documents` tab and press `Generate/Contract` button at the top right corner of the table.

5. In the new window, click on **Template** drop-down list to choose the template created on previous step and press `Load`, the content will be loaded to **Document code** text area.

- **Visible to customer** - the document will be available on *Portal* to download by customer;
