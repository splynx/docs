Customer management
=========

The customer management is a vital task to provide excellent service as an ISP.

The Splynx has taken into consideration every element when dealing with this task and compiled an advanced customer management system that gives you a simple and manageable platform to effortlessly manage your customers.

Our management system consists of 8 main pages for each customer: **information**, **services**, **billing**, **statistics**, **documents**, **CPE**, **CRM** and **Communication**. Please take a look at the sections of our customer management module and how they work.
