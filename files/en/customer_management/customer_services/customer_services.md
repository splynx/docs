Customer services
==========
The customer service tab is where all products/services supplied to that specific customer can be found, edited or new services can be added to the customers account. This is where you control all services for a client which will influence the bill they receive.

It is possible to associate different services for each customer: `bundle`, `Internet service`, `voice service` and `recurring service`.
In order **to add a new service** for the customer, select the *Customer view*, go to the services tab and click `Add service`. Please note that customers have to be active on the system to make us of their services, as well as to be able to add services to their profile.
