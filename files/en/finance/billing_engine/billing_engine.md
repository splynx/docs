Total data for the above mentioned for each of the following periods:

The dashboard also includes the following mini-reports in form of graphs:

* Invoicing for period (VAT Included)
* Payments for period (VAT Included)
* Monthly recurring revenue

Each of the graphs can be customized to view provided time frames for specific partners and locations.

A separate table is also included with information on all overdue invoices.
