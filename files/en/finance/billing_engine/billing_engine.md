In this section, we describe the difference between Recurring and Prepaid billing of a customer.
Let's start with the financial dashboard, which shows us a quick overview regarding information about your Splynx financial status:

Quick totals for the following data and buttons to direct to a list for each:

* Debit transactions
* Payments
* Paid Invoices
* Unpaid invoices

Totals data for the above mentioned for each of the following periods:

* Last Month

The dashboard also includes the following mini-reports in form of graphs:

* Invoicing for period (VAT Included)
* Payments for period (VAT Included)
* Top 10 payers
* Top 10 debtors

Each of the graphs can be customized to view provided time frames for specific partners and locations.

A separate table is also included with information on all overdue invoices
