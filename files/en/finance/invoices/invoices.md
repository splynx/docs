**An invoice** is a commercial document that specify a transaction between a buyer and a seller. 
If goods or services were purchased on credit, the invoice usually specifies the terms of the deal, 
and provide information on the available methods of payment. 
An invoice is also known as a bill or sales invoice.

Splynx provides the ability to work with or without invoices.
Without issuing invoices, Splynx just receives payments and charges customers each invoice 
period without creating an official document. When invoicing is required,
Splynx is able to generate invoices automatically, or the administrator can issue invoices manually.
Invoices can be created conjointly or separately. Invoices in PDF format are fully customizable.
All documents generated by Splynx can be exported to different formats to the end users for
printing or sending.

* **All issued Invoices** can be found in Finance → Invoices. It is possible to range them by Period of time, Partner or Status (Any, Paid, Unpaid, Deleted). Under the list of Invoices will be a Table called "Total", which displays all Invoices for a particular period of time by their status, number of Invoices in each status and amount of money paid and unpaid in each status of Invoice.
