Payments
============

This is the home of all payments in your Splynx system. All payments made by the customer or for the customer by means of all payment methods available are recorded and displayed here.

Splynx is able to process many different methods of payments, to name a few, cash payments, processing and generating of SEPA payment order, bank statement processing and a wide range of payment gateways (Sagepay, etc.)

The Splynx cash desk module can be used to process payments administratively under a restricted and monitored platform.

For more information on the cash desk module please click [ here](addons_modules/cashdesk/cashdesk.md).

The **Payments' table** in the Finance module displays all different types of payments for a particular period of time according to your selection.
You can also range payments by Partner. Under the list of Payments will be a table called *"Totals"*, which will display all types of payments for a particular period of time with a number of payments in each type and amount of money in each type.

**Manual Payments**

Manual payments can be added in Splynx without the use or need of an invoice. This is done in the customer profile in _Billing â†’ Finance documents_. Click on `Add document` and select *Payment* from the drop-down list.
