## How we count active subscribers?

One **active** customer is limited to **4 active services**. When the subscriber has a 5th service, the system counts it as a new **active subscriber to the license**.

GPON addon counts active subscribers separately. If the active subscriber has a GPON Huawei provisioning service, they are counted as **2 active subscribers to the license**.

Hotspot online vouchers are counted as active customers. This means that you can have 10K vouchers in your DB, however, if 100 hotspot users are online at the same time, then a **100 subscription license** is required.

TR-069 devices counts separately. If the active subscriber has a TR-069 active device they are counted as **2 active subscribers to the license**.
