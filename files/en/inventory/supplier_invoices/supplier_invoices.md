* **Supplier** – choose a supplier (obligatory).
* **Supplier invoice number** – invoice number from the supplier (if needed).
* **File** – if you have an invoice file (an image or a document) you can specify it here. It will be downloaded in the system while invoice is creating. Afterwards you can view or download it for your needs.
* **Product** – choose an existing product. Or you can type in a new product name, and a product will be created automatically.
* **Quantity** – items count to add to the system.
* **Price** – purchase price of this item.
