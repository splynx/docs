Customer search fields
=============

Administrators can customize which fields to use when searching for customers within the search feature (`Customers → Search`) and under `Messages → Mass sending → Create`.

By simply enabling or disabling the provided fields, the selected fields can be included or excluded in the search function.

Selected fields can also be made to have a strict comparison to the details entered when searching.
