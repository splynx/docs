Personal IMAP / SMTP configuration
====

Using this feature an administrator can send emails to the customer/lead as a personal message. The conversation between an administrator and the customer/lead will be visible only for a sender and for a receiver. None of other administrators won't be able to see this conversation in Splynx.

You can find this feature configuration in **My Profile** on **IMAP** tab:

![settings location](location.png)

Below you can find a description of all available options to configure.

### Email tracking

![email tracking](email_tracking.png)

* **Enable inbox processing** - enable/disable synchronization of incoming emails between email account and Splynx;

* **Which messages to process** - select _All_ or _Unread_ messages for processing;

* **Process old (historic) messages** - this option allows select of date from which Splynx will try to process emails. If disabled - Splynx will process emails from the moment when processing is enabled;

* **Mark as read** - mark email as read (into email account) if processed by Splynx successfully;

* **Deny list** - a list of emails and domains that will be ignored (won't be synced) by Splynx. Each email/domain should be on a new line;


### Access settings

![access settings](access_settings.png)

Here you can select admins who will have an access to your incoming emails. Be very attentive with this option as all enabled administrators can read your incoming emails.

### Credentials

![credentials](credentials.png)

Here you need to set a username and a password to your email account. In this case it's a Gmail account login/password.


### IMAP settings

![imap settings](test_connection.png)

* **IMAP server** - an address of your IMAP server;

* **IMAP port** - specify IMAP port (usually 143 or 993);

* **Folder name of sent emails** - here you need to click on "Load" button first and after this a folder should be selected automatically. It should be a folder of sent emails and not any other folder.

![folder of sent](folder_of_sent.png)

* **Use SSL** - enable/disable using of SSL when connecting to IMAP server;

* **Don't validate certificate** - enable/disable validation of certificate.

When all these settings are set, click on "Test connection" to ensure that connection between Splynx and mail server is active, if no - check your settings.


### SMTP settings

Here we have an administrator's personal SMTP settings (for email sending).

![smtp settings](smtp.png)

* **Enable sending** - enable/disable sending of email from admin's account;

* **Reply to** - here you can specify an email address to reply;

* **Use system SMTP** - allows to send messages to a customer using system email configuration in `Config → Main → Email`. The global SMTP config settings will be copied to the appropriate fields such as _SMTP server_, _SMTP port_, _SMTP security mode_ and _SMTP authentication type_. Double check if the email address in the field `Sender's email` has the correct format e.g. `username@mailserver.com` in `Config → Main → Email`, exactly this value will be used to send mail, not the value from `Username` field, where the simple login can be used as well.


* **SMTP server** - mail server address;

* **SMTP port** - mail server port (usually 25, 465 or 587);

* **SMTP security mode** - mail server security type (none, TLS or SSL);

* **SMTP authentication type** - type of authentication on mail server.

Don't forget to test connection and send a test email.


### How it works. Example.

Once we have configured IMAP and SMTP in _My Profile_, let's test with some customer.

First we'll send some message directly to Main Admin's email address from some not-registered in Splynx email:

![messages-inbox](inbox_splynx.png)

It's exactly the same message that Main Admin has on his Gmail account:

![gmail account](inbox_gmail.png)

As you can see under _Messages / Inbox_ we received a non-registered message with the mark "Author not found". But near each message we have the "Action" section where we can:
1. View message;
2. Pair to a customer;
3. Add a customer with this email address;
4. Block email;
5. Delete message.

Now let's test with some registered customer.

To create a personal message to a customer navigate to "Communication" tab and click on "Send email":

![send email](communication_tab.png)

![send email 2](sent1.png)

Customer received this message and reply to it:

![reply](reply1.png)

Once customer replied, admin will see this message under Communication tab:

![reply in Splynx](reply_splynx.png)

**Note!** In a previous steps we enabled access to our inbox for _splynx_ admin:

![enabled access](access_settings.png)

It means that _splynx_ admin can view Inbox and messages under _Communication_ tab under customer profile of that admin who allowed this but if _splynx_ admin has no configured IMAP under **My profile** he won't see any messages:

![splynx admin inbox](splynx_admin_inbox.png)
