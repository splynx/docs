`Personal` group is not visible in the table but it is used by default for new responses. The responses created in `My profile` are unique to each user and cannot be used by other administrators in Splynx (except super administrator).

**Canned responses** - pre-configured responses for tickets can be created and saved here to optimize response time and improve efficiency. Simply click on the `+` button to add a new response.
