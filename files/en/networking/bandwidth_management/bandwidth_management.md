Bandwidth management
==========

Splynx has a powerful bandwidth management engine. The software can set speed limitations for customers on different vendors of devices using Radius protocols or you can achieve advanced bandwidth management with the HTB Queuing system of your Mikrotik Router OS. We manage Queues on Mikrotik routers using API. Please read the following articles for more information on bandwidth management in Splynx:
