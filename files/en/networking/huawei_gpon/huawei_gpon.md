Huawei GPON
==========

In Splynx, we have the ability to manage a Huawei GPON from within Splynx.

To use the Splynx Huawei GPON management system, it is necessary to install the module as you would install an addon in Splynx:

From the CLI of your server, you can run the following commands:

```
apt update
apt install splynx-huawei-olt
```

Alternatively, you can install it from Splynx:

 Navigate to *Config → Integrations → Add-ons:*

Locate the "splynx-huawei-olt" addon and click on the install button:

To add an OLT, navigate to `Networking → Huawei GPON`, the IP, ssh port, and login/password are required to add the device. Also, it is of great importance to set the UPLINK BOARD and the UPLINK INTERFACE correctly.

After the OLT is added, we will be presented with a menu containing four different pages.
