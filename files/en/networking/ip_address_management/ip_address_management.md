IP address management
==========

IP addresses are used in every corporate or ISP network. They are an essential component of  networking. There are several ways to manage IP address assignments. Many administrators, even in large companies, are still using Excel sheets due to a lack of smart IP address management tools. We recommend our engine for IP address management to ease the pressure on administrators and improve overall efficiency. This module is connected to the customer database in Splynx. When Splynx assigns an IP address or subnet to a customer for their access, the IPs will be assigned in the IP address management tab as well. The main advantage of this is avoiding IP conflicts when several customers get the same IP or an IP with the wrong range. Also, you always have an overview of the current state of your subnets.
