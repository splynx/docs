 Networking
 ==========

Important part of Splynx software is Network management. We use the following technologies for Network Management:

* **Radius protocol** – central customer authentication, locking non-payers, getting statistics of Internet usage, support of different vendors.

* **Mikrotik API** – advanced bandwidth management on RouterOS. CPE configuration and provisioning.

* **SNMP** - monitoring and building weathermaps directly in Splynx.
