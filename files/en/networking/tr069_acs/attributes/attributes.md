Attributes
==========
Here we can add the custom attributes to be displayed under ACS devices in Splynx. For example, we need to display a DNS attribute on the main info of device:

![attributes](attributes.png)

Once the attribute is added, you need to connect some devices to proceed with its configuration.

You will be able to display all these attributes:

![genie_attrtbiutes](genie_attributes.png)

Once some devices are added and you have groups available, click on **Attributes config** near some group:

![attributes config](load_attributes.png)

Select a device and click the `Load` button to load attributes. After the load, the attributes are ready for use:

![available attributes](available_attributes.png)

![available attributes](available_attributes1.png)

and after its configuration you'll see the attribute values on the device overview or in customers list:
