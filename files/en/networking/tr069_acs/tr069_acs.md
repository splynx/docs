TR-069 (ACS - Auto configuration server)
==========

Starting from Splynx v3.1 we have in-built ACS server based on [GenieACS](https://genieacs.com/) - open source TR-069 remote management solution with advanced device provisioning capabilities. **GenieACS** can work with any device that supports the TR-069 protocol. It auto-discovers the device’s parameter tree (including vendor-specific parameters) making no assumptions about the device’s data model.

You can configure devices directly from Splynx web page. Please use the following tutorials:
