The Intelligent Retries feature is currently available for *Bacs (GBP), SEPA (EUR), Autogiro (SEK), Becs (AUD), Becs NZ (NZD), PAD (CAD)*, and *ACH (USD)* payments. Click the toggle next to the currency you wish to enable;

### Direct payments

Using the payments links is the simplest way to accept payments from customers. This feature is available in the *Gocardless* add-on to pay *Invoices* and *Proforma Invoices*. This provides convenience and simplicity for your customers, so the amount of on-time payments will increase. For example, you can add a payment link to the email with the (proforma) invoice, as a result, the customer can make payment quickly by clicking onto such link instead of logging in to their *Portal* page. In case the customer has saved the payment credentials on the *Portal*, they do not need to add further details when using the direct payment link in the future. If the credit card in not linked on the *Portal*, the payment details need to be entered each time the payment link is used.

To create a direct payment link, please use the patterns below:

**To pay the Invoice:**

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>by invoice ID</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

```
https://<splynx_domain_address>/gocardless/direct-pay-invoice-by-id?item_id=<Invoice_id>

```
</div>
</details>

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">

</div>
</details>

<br>

**To pay the Proforma Invoice:**

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">

```
</div>
</details>

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
