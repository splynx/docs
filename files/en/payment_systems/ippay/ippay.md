Moreover, if one or both payment methods are added by the customer, the **administrator can pay the invoices directly from customer's profile**:

If everything goes well, you will see the status of invoice marked as `Paid` (on the customer and admin portal):

On the customer *Portal Dashboard*, customers can also see the list of non-paid invoices in *Ippay* widget (entry point) and the same-name buttons to pay such invoices.

More information about *Modules list* can be found [here](configuration/integrations/modules_list/modules_list.md).

### Direct payments

Using the payments links is the simplest way to accept payments made with credit card or bank account. This feature is available in the *IPpay* add-on to pay *Invoices* and *Proforma Invoices*. This provides convenience and simplicity for your customers, so the amount of on-time payments will increase. For example, you can add a payment link to the e-mail with the (proforma) invoice, as a result, the customer can make payment quickly by clicking onto such link instead of logging in to their *Portal* page. In case the customer has saved the payment credentials on the *Portal*, they do not need to add further details when using the direct payment link in the future. If the credit card in not linked on the *Portal*, the payment details need to be entered each time the payment link is used.

To create a direct payment link, please use the patterns below:

**To pay the Invoice:**

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>by invoice ID</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

```
https://<splynx_domain_address>/ippay/direct-pay-invoice-by-id?item_id=<Invoice_id>

```
</div>
</details>

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>by invoice number</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

```
https://<splynx_domain_address>/ippay/direct-pay-invoice?item_id=<Invoice_number>

```
</div>
</details>

<br>

**To pay the Proforma Invoice:**

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>by proforma invoice ID</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

```
https://<splynx_domain_address>/ippay/direct-pay-proforma-by-id?item_id=<proforma_id>

```
</div>
</details>

<details style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<summary><b>by proforma invoice number</b></summary>
<div markdown="1">

```
https://<splynx_domain_address>/ippay/direct-pay-proforma?item_id=<proforma_number>

```
</div>
