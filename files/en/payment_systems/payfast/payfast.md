Payfast.co.za payments
======================

Payfast is a Splynx add-on which allows refilling of customer balances and paying invoices via the [PayFast payment gateway](https://www.payfast.co.za).

We've developed two different add-ons for using this payment system: **splynx-payfast** and **splynx-payfast-rb**.

The first add-on - `splynx-payfast` is used for payments which proceed only in the PayFast system.

The second add-on - `splynx-payfast-rb` can work with different credit-cards using PayFast and allows you to charge all customers by using **Direct debit order**.

<icon class="image-icon">![image](warning.png)</icon> **WARNING!** PayFast makes use of ports *80*, *8080*, *8081* and *443* only. So your `Splynx Url` has to be on the same ports!

The add-ons can be installed in two method, via the CLI or the Web UI of your Splynx server.


### splynx-payfast

**Merchant details**:

NAME | DESCRIPTION

merchant_id | The Merchant ID as given by the PayFast system. Used to uniquely identify the receiving account. This can be found on the merchant’s settings page.
merchant_key | The Merchant Key as given by the PayFast system. Used to uniquely identify the receiving account. This provides an extra level of certainty concerning the correct account as both the ID and the Key must be correct in order for the transaction to proceed. This can be found on the merchant’s settings page.

Thereafter, customers can pay for their invoices and refill their balances using the PayFast system. Customers will see a new icon <icon class="image-icon">![](payfast_icon.png)</icon> to pay as shown below:

Also, it's necessary to set your **Notify Url**, e.g. ``` https://<your_domain>/payfast-rb/notify ```, when the successful payment is made, *PayFast* will send an *Instant Transaction Notifications (payment confirmation)* to this url before a customer gets redirected to **return_url**:

More info related to recurring billing integration is [here](https://developers.payfast.co.za/docs#recurring_billing).

Once these options were configured, you have to configure the parameters in `Config → Integrations → Modules list` as shown below:

To **add a PayFast-RB payment account**, a customer should navigate to their [Portal](customer_portal/customer_portal.md), open `Finance → PayFast-RB` and enter their credentials.

### Direct payments using PayFast and PayFast-RB


Using the payments links is the simplest way to accept payments made with credit card. This feature is available in the *PayFast* and *PayFast-RB* addons to pay *Invoices* and *Proforma Invoices*. This provides convenience and simplicity for your customer, so the amount of on-time payments will increase. For example, you can add a payment link to the email with the (proforma) invoice, as a result, the customer can make payment quickly by clicking onto this link instead of logging in to their *Portal* page. In case the customer has saved the card details on the *Portal*, they do not need to add further details when using the direct payment link in the future. If the credit card in not linked on the *Portal*, the payment details need to be entered each time the payment link is used.

To **create a direct payment link**, please use the patterns below:
