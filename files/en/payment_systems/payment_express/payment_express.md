Individual Posts are sent, with correctly formatted XML fields, to the relevant PxPost endpoint;

* **Currency** - select a currency. Windcave supports a number of currencies, which can be used with all interfaces;


**Payment Express PxPost credentials**

The customer can refill their balance using the **Add money by Payment Express** menu on *Portal Dashboard* (the `paymentexpress_add_money_on_dashboard` entry point should be enabled).

If the customer is logged into the *Portal*, the following link to refill the balance ``` https://<splynx_domain_address>/paymentexpress ``` is supported as well.

The administrator of Splynx can also top up the customer's balance using the **Pay Now** button on the *Billing Overview* tab of customer's profile (the `paymentexpress_add_money_by_admin` entry point should be enabled).

### Direct payment

Using the payment link is the simplest way to accept payment made with credit card (the **credentials should be entered every time**). This feature is available in the *Payment Express* add-on to pay the *Invoices*.

To create a **direct payment link to pay the invoice**, please use the pattern below:

```
https://<splynx_domain_address>/paymentexpress/direct-pay-invoice?item_id=<Invoice_number>

```
