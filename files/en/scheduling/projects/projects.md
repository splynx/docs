Projects
======
This is the main sub module of the scheduling displaying a list of all your projects at hand. Each project shows how many tasks it consists of,
how many tasks are in progress and the number of tasks already done for the project.

<icon class="image-icon">![Note](note.png)</icon> Just like all tables/lists in Splynx, the data displayed within them can be customized
to your preference by using the breadcrumbs icon at the top right of each list:
