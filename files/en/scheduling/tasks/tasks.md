Tasks
======

Every project has various tasks that we create and assign to a specific administrator. Tasks can be created by clicking the **Add** button in `Scheduling > Tasks`.

![Tasks](tasks_table.png)

The existing tasks can be filtered by a specific project, priority or assignee.

It is also possible to create the tasks directly from the ticket you are working with by clicking the **Create task** button in the top right corner of the page.

Once clicked, the new window will appear:

It is possible to have various task templates to optimize the routine/process of adding new tasks. You can create your own templates at `Config > Scheduling > Task templates`.

Every task has action buttons that allows you to:
