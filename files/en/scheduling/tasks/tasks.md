Tasks
======

Every project has various tasks that we create and assign to a specific administrator. Tasks can be created by clicking the **Add** button in `Scheduling > Tasks`.

The existing tasks can be filtered by a specific project, priority or assignee.

It is also possible to create the tasks directly from the ticket you are working with by clicking the **Create task** button in the top right corner of the page.

Once clicked, the new window will appear:

It is possible to have various task templates to optimize the routine/process of adding new tasks. You can create your own templates at `Config > Scheduling > Task templates`.

It is possible to edit task overview, to mark the checklist steps, to log the time spent, edit task description, re-schedule the task or simply check the activity log.

Every task has action buttons that allows you to:

Another feature that optimizes you functionality with tasks is an action log  that is located at the bottom of the tasks window. It allows you to track all the activities that were performed within the task, check the worklog and task comments.
