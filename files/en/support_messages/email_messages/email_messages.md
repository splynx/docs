You don't have to fill out all the fields to send an email to a customer. The easiest way is to enter a customer's **Portal login** or **Full name**, choose the **Send to** option, type a **Subject** and write a message.

You can choose a message body from templates or write particular text to populate the body of the message. You can also type your own message and save it as a new template by clicking on `Save as new` button or load the existing one. There is also an option to attach customer's financial documents.
