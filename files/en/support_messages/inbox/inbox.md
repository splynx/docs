Inbox
==============

**NOTE:** To use the **Inbox** feature it's **required** to make [Personal IMAP / SMTP configuration](my_profile/imap/imap.md) in `My Profile → IMAP (tab)`.

If you plan to use **global SMTP** in Splynx, please configure it in `Config → Main → Email` and enable **Use system SMTP** option in `My Profile → IMAP (tab)`.


The **Inbox** feature in `Messages → Inbox` allows you to add your personal email address into Splynx in order to simplify communication with potential or existing customers. It would be like a simple [mail client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client) with a configured mail box via IMAP.
