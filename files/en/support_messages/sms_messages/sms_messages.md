You don't have to fill out all the fields to send an SMS to a customer. The easiest way is to enter a customer's **Portal login** or **Full name**, choose **Send to** `SMS` option, write a message.

You can choose a message body from SMS template or write particular text to populate the body of the message. You can also type your own message and save it as a new template by clicking on `Save as new` button or load the existing one.
